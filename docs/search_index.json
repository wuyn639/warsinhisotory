There are several reasons to engage in the careful study of history of wars. It can be used to better understand our heritage and the challenges faced and overcame by previous generations. It can remind us of the true cost of war and act as a staunch warning against recklessly engaging in needless military conflict. Through this project, we specifically look for trends and effects on education, military expenditures, human development index, etc of countries that were engaged in war, in addition to exploring their general characteristics. We also compare the effects of different wars on countries. The GitHub repository of our codes can be found here. The following demonstrations done by Google Voyager showcase the 10 key battles of the WW1, memorial sites of WW1 and remnants of WW2 in the pacific. The scale and aftermath of the two wars can be clearly seen through the demonstrations. About the terms/data sets used in the project (Typology of Wars): Inter State Wars refer to all the wars that took place between different countries of the world. For example, World War I and World War II are two specific inter state wars. Intra State Wars refer to wars that took place inside of countries (non state actors). Others terms used are military expenditure, GDP per capita, Human Development Index, Number of battle deaths, etc., which are self explanatory. More about these details are available in the upcoming chapter 2. Note: This project is color blind friendly. "],
["data-sources.html", "Chapter 2 Data sources 2.1 Sources 2.2 Format 2.3 Variables 2.4 Additional information 2.5 Issues with data sets", " Chapter 2 Data sources 2.1 Sources Correlates of War We got our main war data from The Correlates of War (COW) Project by David Singer and Mel Small. Singer and Small have utilized a classification of wars that is based upon the status of territorial entities, in particular focusing on those that are classified as members of the inter-state system (referred to as “states”). Inter-state wars were those that were conducted between or among members of the interstate system. For example, World War I and World War II would be considered inter-state wars. Intra-state wars are wars that predominantly take place within the recognized territory of a state. Intra-state wars have been subdivided into three general types, based upon the status of the combatants: civil wars involve the government of the state against a non-state entity; regional internal wars(war type 6) involve the government of a regional subunit against a non-state entity; and intercommunal wars(war type 7) involve combat between/among two or more non-state entities within the state. Civil wars have then been subdivided further into two types; those for control of the central government(war type 4), and those involving disputes over local issues(war type 5). The U.S. civil war will be considered civil wars for central control(war type 4). Non-state wars include those wars conducted by non-system member actors that take place beyond the confines of one state. Non -state wars have been subdivided into two types: wars between or among non-state entities that take place in non-state territory (war type 8, of which there are sixty-one) and wars between non-state armed groups that take place across state borders (war type 9, of which they have identified one), are included in the Non-State War dataset. All 62 non-state wars took place in the 1500s. Extra-state wars take place between a state(s) and a nonstate entity outside the borders of the state and were subdivide into two types: colonial (war type 2) and imperial(war type 3). A colonial extra-state war tends to occur when a colony rebels and tries to become independent. In addition, the colonial people may resort to war to seek relief on a policy question, rather than seeking independence. In imperial wars, the system member fights an adversary that is, “an independent political entity that did not qualify for system membership because of serious limitations on its independence, a population insufficiency, or a failure of other states to recognize it as a legitimate member.” In practice, most of the imperial wars in this dataset involved a state’s attempt to colonize a previously independent geographic area, though extra-state wars can also be fought against non-territorially based entities. Here is a summary of typology of wars defined by Singer and Small: Inter-state wars (war type 1) Extra-state wars Colonial-conflict with colony (war type 2) Imperial-state vs nonstate (war type 3) Intra-state wars Civil Wars For central control (war type 4) Over local issues (war type 5) Regional internal (war type 6) Intercommunal (war type 7) Non-state wars In nonstate territory (war type 8) Across state borders (war type 9) Link: https://correlatesofwar.org/ Maddison Project Database 2018 Maddison Project Database provided us with historic population and real GDP per capita data.

For instance, the Franco-Spanish War is between Spain and France and there is one row of observation for each participating country. For intra-state war dataset and extra-state war dataset, most wars also have multiple rows of observations, where the number of rows is the maximum number of participants on either side of that war. For instance, Ottoman Empire is on side A of the Greek Independence War and side B consists of Greeks, United Kingdom, France and Russia. Therefore, the number of rows got is 4 for Greek Independence War. We also note that in the case that one side has fewer participants than the other, the participants will not be repeated but will be coded as -8(not applicable). For the same example as above, side A only has Ottoman Empire and Ottoman Empire is in one row while the other three rows on the same war has -8 for side A, instead of repeating Ottoman Empire. For non-state war dataset, each war only has one row of observation. 2.5 Issues with data sets Correlates of War There is no war data after 2010 so the war dataset is not exactly up to date. There is only one observation for type 9 war data which is the non-state wars between non-state armed groups that take place across state borders. Furthermore, the battle death data is only an estimate: they utilized a 3:1 ratio of wounded to killed in order to calculate the number of battle-related deaths when only casualty estimates are available. However, the dataset is quite extensive with data dating back to the 16th century and other sources also only provide estimated values for death. This dataset still provides us with plenty insights on the relative magnitude of the costs of war participation. Maddison Project Database 2018 While this dataset seems to be the most extensive as it comes to historic data on real GDP per capita and population, some of the data are extrapolated. Primary School Enrollment, Military Expenditure as a share of GDP, Human Development Index All of them don’t have data regarding all countries involved in World War I (or II). We chose those countries that were a part of WWI or WWII (but all were not present). Another issue was that even if countries were available, data concerning them for all years were not available. We could only analyze those that matched the timeline of WWI and WWII. "],
["data-transformation.html", "Chapter 3 Data transformation 3.1 COW data 3.2 Choropleth maps", " Chapter 3 Data transformation In this chapter, we discuss the process of getting the data into a form which we could easily work with in R. 3.1 COW data The 4 data sets we downloaded as csv files from COW website are clean with each variable defined clearly. Generally, for each question we are interested in exploring, we selected the related variables only and transformed them into the format for plotting, by dplyr package functions such as mutate(), select(), filter(), group_by(), summarise() and tidyr package functions like gather() and spread(). For example, to answer what types of wars happened most frequently, we first added one column for its general war type, and then selected WarNum, WarName, and WarType, and finally combined 4 data frames by row. Specially, we changed the WarType as a factor to war type plus brief description. For another instance, to answer which states suffered from most losses of human beings in battles, we picked state name and number of battle death for each data set, and changed the data type of number of battle deaths into uniform numeric data type without comma. Then we replaced negative number of battle deaths with NA. Then the cleaned data is ready for row binding and the last step includes grouping by state and counting the sum of deaths for each state. Other data transformation processes are similar except for selection of different set of columns. In order to answer some other questions incorporating both states and wars, for example, what states had most which type of wars, we performed more steps before combining by rows. It should be noticed that data sets of non-state wars, intra-state wars, and extra-state wars has each war as one row, which means there would be at least two states or sides for each row. Thus, in the three data sets, war name and war code are unique. On the other hand, in the inter-state data set, the combination of war name (war code) and state name is unique, which means one wars may range across multiple rows with each row recording information of one state involved in that war. It is the major different between these two kinds of data sets and we transformed data sets of intra-state, extra-state, and non-state wars into the format of data for inter-state wars. In other words, after the transformation, when all wars appear in one dataset, the pair of (WarName, StateName) is unique. The transformation algorithm is described below: Intra-state: if a war appears with two sides, then: if CcodeA is valid, add new row (WarNum, WarName, WarType, StateName=sideA, ccode=CcodeA, BatDeath = SideADeaths) to data frame sideA; if CcodeB is valid, add new row (WarNum, WarName, WarType, StateName=sideB, ccode=CcodeB, BatDeath = SideBDeaths) to data frame sideB; row-bind sideA and sideB to form intra-state data frame with 6 variables WarNum, WarName, WarType, StateName, ccode, BatDeath. Inter-state: if ccode is valid, then add new row (WarNum, WarName, Type, StateName, ccode, BatDeath) to data frame inter-state with 6 variables WarNum, WarName, WarType, StateName, ccode, BatDeath. Extra-state: there are no wars with both SideA and SideB existing, which means each row represents a war with one side record and then: we can then safely add BatDeath and NonStateDeaths as total BatDeath if ccode1 is valid, add new row (WarNum, WarName, WarType, StateName=SideA,ccode=ccode1, BatDeath) to data frame sideA; if ccode2 is valid, add new row (WarNum, WarName, WarType, StateName=SideB,ccode=ccode2, BatDeath) to data frame sideB; row-bind sideA and sideB to form extra-state data frame with 6 variables WarNum, WarName, WarType, StateName, ccode, BatDeath. Non-state: these wars are not about countries or states, and thus we did not take them into consideration in this particular case. Note that being valid here means the ccode is not negative based on the codebook of COW and it exists in another data set provided by COW of a list of states and corresponding codes. Furthermore, all numbers of deaths were cleaned to be numbers. 3.2 Choropleth maps When plotting choropleth maps, we found there are some states or countries that currently do not exist and consequently do not appear in R’s world map data set, such as USSR. To deal with this issue, we recoded all countries that were in USSR during World War II as USSR and added those countries that still exist now into world data again. As a result, the world data set now should contain the geology data of all countries we have. "],
["missing-values.html", "Chapter 4 Missing values 4.1 Inter-state Wars Dataset 4.2 Intra-state Wars Dataset 4.3 Extra-state Wars Dataset 4.4 Non-state Wars Dataset", " Chapter 4 Missing values From the codebook, we know that -9 is used to encode variable with unknown values. Therefore, we need to encode all variables with value -9 as NA. Note that the value -8 encodes “not applicable” which is different from missing. 4.1 Inter-state Wars Dataset Figure 4.1: Visna Graph of Missing Data Pattern for Inter-state Wars Dataset From the visna plot, we can observe that most rows have no variables missing. There is one row with BatDeath(battle death) data missing. 4.2 Intra-state Wars Dataset Figure 4.2: Visna Graph of Missing Data Pattern for Intra-state Wars Dataset We observe that most rows have no missing variables. The most common missing data pattern is having SideADeath and SideBDeath data missing. It’s rare having more than three variables missing in this dataset. 4.3 Extra-state Wars Dataset Figure 4.3: Visna Graph of Missing Data Pattern for Extra-state Wars Dataset We observe that most rows have no missing variables. The most common missing data pattern is having StartDay1(the day on which sustained combat began) data missing. It’s rare having more than two variables missing in this dataset. 4.4 Non-state Wars Dataset Figure 4.4: Visna Graph of Missing Data Pattern for Non-state Wars Dataset We observe that there are more rows with missing data than without missing data. The most common missing data pattern is having SideADeath, SideBDeath and TotalCombatDeaths data missing. We also observe that if we have SideADeaths, SideBDeaths missing, then we often also have TotalCombatDeaths missing which makes sense since TotalCombatDeaths is the sum of SideADeath and SideBDeath.

["results.html", "Chapter 5 Results 5.1 General EDAV 5.2 World War I and World War II 5.3 External statistics", " Chapter 5 Results In this chapter, we give a summary of findings for our analysis. In general, there are three subsections, which are general exploratory data visualization, focus on World War I and World War II, and linkage to external indicative statistics such as GDP per capita, population, and military expenditure. For all plots, colors are color-vision-deficiency-friendly by using tested palettes. 5.1 General EDAV 5.1.1 Number of wars by type To begin with our analysis, we first explored what types of wars happened most frequently as the original war data sets are divided by 4 war types: intra-state, inter-state, extra-state, and non-state wars. We observe from Figure 1 that intra-state wars happened the most with over 400 occurrences throughout history, followed by inter-state wars, then extra-state wars with non-state wars being the least common war type. Considering that the scale of inter-state wars is usually larger than scale of intra-state wars, the larger number of occurrences of intra-state wars is expected and non-state wars are the least common with least occurrences. In addition, according to Figure 2 and definitions of wars types, we found that: Within extra-state wars, two thirds of extra-state wars are imperial and one third of extra-state wars are colonial. Inter-state wars are not divided into further categories. More than half of the intra-state wars are civil wars for central control, while 40% are civil wars for local issues. In terms of the remaining intra-state wars, there are approximately twice number of intercommunal wars than regional internal wars. Among all non-state wars, the majority of wars happened in non-state territories while little were cross state borders (in fact only one war was across state borders). 5.1.2 Number of wars by state Apart from which war types were the most common, it also seems interesting to explore what states participated most frequently in the wars, whether their participation was “active”(they were initiators of the wars) or “passive”(they were non initiators of the wars). For this question, we did not take non-state wars into consideration because non-state wars are not about states or countries, as implied from the name “non-state”. For Figure 3, after combining intra-state, extra-state and inter-state wars by state name, there are 160 states (rows) in total and we picked the first 80 states that were ever involved in the wars most frequently, to make cleveland plots more clear. Based on Figure 3, United Kingdom, France, China, Russia, and Ottoman Empire were involved in the wars more frequently, which is not a surprising finding considering these states’ history and size. In addition, the numbers of wars in which United Kingdom and France participated are far more than that of the remaining states. When we look into each war type, there is new information based on Figure 4, Figure 5, and Figure 6. United Kingdom only appeared to be most involved in extra-state wars, which is reasonable in terms of its colonization before 19th century. France and Spain rank second and third for participating in extra-state wars as states that developed in the First Industrial Revolution and seeked colonial expansion. China has most intra-state wars with Ottoman Empire and Russia rank as second and third, which may be related to state’s larger population and longer history. Finally, France, United States of America, and United Kingdom have been involved in most inter-state wars. There is another point worth noticing that there are many more intra-state and inter-state wars than extra-state wars for each state, corresponding to the findings in Figure 1. 5.1.3 Number of war deaths A part we can never ignore about wars is the number of deaths caused. Here, we demonstrate the number of battle deaths, the battle-related combatant fatalities suffered by the state. We first explore which war type caused the most number of battle deaths and it can be observed from Figure 7 the war type is inter-state wars, with a number over 30 million standing out among all other types. Now please think of one war in history that you believe caused most battle deaths and scroll down to Figure 8 to check your answer. Notice that we took log of the number of battle deaths due to the large number. The two wars with most human losses are World War II and World War I and the number of deaths for World War II (over 16.5 million) is almost twice of the number for World War I (about 8 million). This might be one of the reasons that these are the two most famous wars in history. Another war causing a large number of deaths is Iran-Iraq war (about 1.5 million), but an obvious break of link between world wars and other wars can be seen clearly. Here is another question from the perspective of each state: what states had most losses of human lives due to the war? According to Figure 9, three states lost far more human lives than other states, which are USSR, Germany, and China. Russia ranked fourth, Japan is the fifth with France as the sixth. Russia appeared here simultaneously with USSR since we treated USSR (WWI) and Russia (WWII) as separate states in that they existed in different periods. Germany’s high ranking is unexpected considering its population but also makes sense because Germany is one of the members on both World War I Alliance and World War II Axis Powers. Russia, Japan, and France showed up close in a group in the cleveland plot in addition to the first three states. On the other hand, the majority of states suffered losses of human lives in wars with a number less than 1 million. 5.1.4 Correlation between wars and death counts From the previous exploratory data visualizations, it is reasonable to infer there should be a correlation between the number of wars and number of battle deaths for states. As a result, in this part we explored in more details for this question of the relationship between two categorical variables. There seems to be a very weak positive correlation between number of wars a country participated in and the number of total battle deaths in those wars based on Figure 10 and Figure 11. While France and UK participated in the most wars, with France participating in more than 60 wars and UK participating in more than 80 wars, their battle deaths are still lower than Germany, USSR, China and Russia, even though those countries/states are in way fewer wars. While France and Japan have around the same total battle deaths, those deaths were from fewer than 20 wars for Japan while for France, those deaths were from more than 60 wars. Germany and USSR participated in under 20 wars but their total battle deaths were higher than any other countries. 5.1.5 Inter-state wars: Correlation between initiators and winners We might think more initiators lose the war they initiated (thinking about Germany in WWI and WWII) and to deal with this initiative, we made the mosaic plot Figure 12. First of all, there are fewer initiators than non-initiators and there are slightly more winners than losers for all wars. In addition, few wars ended up as tied. For winners of a war, there are more non-initiators. For losers of a war, a higher percentage of states are non-initiators. If more initiators truly lose the war than non-initiators, we would expect a higher percentage of losers to be initiators which is the opposite case. More specially, according to Figure 13, France initiated the most inter-state wars (8 wars), while U.S., Russia and Japan initiated the second most inter-state wars (7 wars). Syria, Thailand, Saudi Arabia, South Africa and Uganda initiated 0 inter-state wars. There seems to be a positive correlation between the number of wars a country is in and the number of wars it initiated. France initiated the most inter-state wars and were in the most number of wars. Syria, Thailand, Saudi Arabia, South Africa and Uganda initiated no inter-state wars and are among the countries that participated in the least number of wars. Parallel coordinate plots can be used to visualize outliers in a dataset. In the below parallel coordinate plot, we can see that USSR seems to be an outlier: it has way higher battle deaths than every other country that participated in the war. There seems to be a trend for non-initiators to have lower battle deaths, however USSR doesn’t follow this trend. USSR was not an initiator but has the highest number of battle deaths. Parallel coordinate plots can be used to visualize outliers in a dataset. In the above parallel coordinate plot, we can see that USSR seems to be an outlier: it has way higher battle deaths than every other country that participated in the war. There seems to be a trend for non-initiators to have lower battle deaths, however USSR doesn’t follow this trend. USSR was not an initiator but has the highest number of battle deaths. 5.2 World War I and World War II In Figure 8, we notice the two wars with most number of deaths are World War I and World War II, which correspond to the two most famous wars in history of the world. Therefore, we decided to focus on these two world wars for the following analysis. Based on Figure 15, Germany, China and Russia are the three countries with the most number of total deaths in all inter-state wars(in that same order). South American Countries, Canada and Australia are among the countries with the least number of total battle deaths. The state with the most death in both wars is USSR and its battle deaths more than tripled in WWII: it had 2 million battle deaths during WWI and more than 6 million battle deaths during WWII. The overall battle death level is higher during WWII than WWI. We can observe that a lot more countries participated in WWII than WWI. For the countries that participated in both wars, all of them suffered more battle deaths in WWII than in WWI. While the state with the most battle deaths in both wars is USSR, it is not the country that stayed in the war the longest. For most countries that participated in both wars, the number of days they were in the war increased from WWI to WWI. Some European countries such as France were in the WWII for a shorter amount of time than WWI while Germany stayed in WWII longer than it stayed in WWI. 5.3 External statistics Wars do not only result in a large number of casualties but also impose effects on a wide range of aspects such as GDP pertica, population, living standards of civilians, military expenditure, education, etc. Again, we only focus on states like Japan, Russia, Germany, China, United Kingdom, France that participated both in WWI and WWII. 5.3.1 World War I 5.3.1.1 Real GDP per capita and population Real GDP per capita during WWI: At the time of WWI, UK and US had the highest level of real GDP per capita while Japan and USSR had the lowest.While US suffered a drop in real GDP per capita before WWI, its real GDP per capita actually increased during the war but dipped down again in 1919. UK’s real GDP per capita plateaued during the war but dropped significantly after the war. Germany suffered a drop in real GDP per capita before WWI and its real GDP per capita during WWI was also at a plateau and dropped even more immediately after the war is over before finally bouncing back in 1919. Japan’s real GDP per capita steadily increased from 1910 to 1922. The USSR’s real GDP per capita dropped significantly during the war and stayed at the same level it was at at the end of the war until 1922. France’s real GDP per capita increased until 1916 but dropped significantly during the last two years of the war before bouncing back after the war. Population during WWI: It should be noted that USSR’s population data is only present for the years 1913, 1920-1922. It is possible that the values are missing due to the fact that USSR wasn’t a state until early 1920s. Population for US and Japan steadily increased from 1910 to 1922 and seems to be completely unaffected by the war. Population for Germany and UK stayed around the same during the war before dropping a little after the war.France’s population dropped during the war and increased slightly after the war. 5.3.1.2 Military expenditure trends The above two graphs were plotted to gather insights regarding the military expenditure of the countries that were involved in world war 1. There are two graphs here - one shows the expenditure by the countries spanning over the years present in the dataset (~1825 - ~2006) and the second spans 10 years before and after the war under consideration. As one would expect, the military expenditure spiked in a very steep manner during the war years. World War 1 spanned over the years of 1914 - 1917 and we can see sharp increase in the military expenditure during these years, especially by countries like Russia, Austria-Hungary and Germany. In the first graph, we can also observe the increase in military expenditure during time periods ~1940. This time period was actually when World War 2 took place which justifies the spikes. Not surprisingly, the countries that show high increase in their military expenditure were also the most active during the wars. These graphs are easy to read by those with colorblindness as they have been plotted using the viridis color palette. 5.3.1.3 Primary school enrollment percentage trends We wanted to explore if the education of children was starkly affected due to the world wars in the countries that actively took part in the wars. Hence, we used a dataset that contained the primary school enrolment of kids in the countries that were active in the wars. As can be clearly seen from the graph, in most of the countries, there is a downfall of the values in the time period 1914-1917. Children in countries such as Russia and Greece were severely affected. The nations’ focus had surely shifted from welfare and education of kids to wars. Surprisingly, we found that the primary school enrolment in Germany was unaffected and had been increasing steadily. 5.3.1.4 Human development index trends The above shown plots were an attempt to analyze the affect of World War 1 on the human development index. The Human Development Index (HDI) is an index that measures key dimensions of human development. The three key dimensions are:1 – A long and healthy life – measured by life expectancy. – Access to education – measured by expected years of schooling of children at school-entry age and mean years of schooling of the adult population. – And a decent standard of living – measured by Gross National Income per capita (adjusted for the price level of the country. We plotted the trends of HDI over the years present in the dataset and also near to the time period of World War 1. We found that there was no considerable effect of World War 1 on human development index. 5.3.2 World War II 5.3.2.1 Real GDP per capita and population Real GDP per capita during WWII: Real GDP per capita for Germany, U.S. and U.K. were very similar in 1935 and they were the countries with the highest real GDP per capita. During most part of WWII real GDP per capita for those three increased steadily, while all dropping towards the end of the war with different magnitude of the drop. Germany experienced a significant drop in real GDP per capita, where it dropped to only 1/3 of where it was at starting from 1944. France also experienced a significant drop in real GDP per capita at the start of the war, at the end of the war, it dropped to only 1/2 of where it was at before war. Population during WWII: While USSR had the highest population among the 6 countries, it also experienced the decrease in population after the war starts. Germany and France also experienced a drop in population after the war starts but the magnitude of the drop isn’t as significant as that of USSR. Population for US and Japan increased steadily over the period 1935-1949 while population for UK stayed around the same. All countries‘ population went back to increasing about one year after the war ends. Comparison between WWI and WWII: WWII seems to have a greater negative effect on real GDP per capita for countries like Germany and France as we can see from the size of the drop, wile GDP per capita for U.S. increased more during WWII than WWI. WWI and WWII seem to have similar effects on population for countries except for former USSR. Since most population data for USSR during the WWI is missing, it’s impossible for us the make comparison on how the effects of WWI and WWII differ on USSR’s population. It’s quite surprising that population in most countries don’t seem to be affected by the wars, for example, Japan’s population steadily increased during both wars. 5.3.2.2 Military expenditure trends The above two are plots of military expenditure trends of countries involved in World War 2, similar to the one for World War 1. First plot shows the expenditure from 1820s - 2006 and the second shows near to the time period of world war 2. We can see sharp increase in military expenditures of certain countries such as Italy, France, etc. There are some lines which are no continuous which correspond to missing data. Certain military expenditures data are not present in the dataset used. 5.3.2.3 Primary school enrolment percentage trends To explore the effects of World War 2 over children’s education, the above graph was plotted. In contrast with the graph of World War 1, this graph concerning countries involved in World War 2 does not show clear and significant patterns.Certain countries like China and Canada saw an increase in primary school enrollment whereas some other countries like Australia and Italy saw a decrease. 5.3.2.4 Human development index trends Similar to the results observed in the graph of HDI for countries involved in World War I, here as well there are no observable or clear patterns to the changes in HDI for the time period of World War II.

["interactive-component.html", "Chapter 6 Interactive component 6.1 Interactive networks 6.2 Interactive choropleth map", " Chapter 6 Interactive component 6.1 Interactive networks Link to the Shiny app: https://priyankalahoti.shinyapps.io/shinyapp/ To better understand or obtain insights such as which countries were most active in the wars and with whom, we plotted the wars (World War 1 and World War 2) in a graphical manner. Each node in the graph represents a country which was a part of the war being visualized and each edge represents the fact that those two countries which are connected to the edge on either end, were involved in a war against each other. Usage of the app: The drop-down menu enables users to select if they want to visualize the countries involved in World War 1 or in World War 2. Once selected, the app graphically visualizes the countries. On clicking on a country, the countries it was involved in a war with, get highlighted and hence one can visually see the number of countries that were against and also which countries these were. The nodes can be reordered and can be dragged around on the screen. There is also an option to zoom in and out of the image for better visibility and inspection by the user. Packages Used: Shiny - Used for building and deploying the Shiny app locally; Shinythemes - Used to change the theme of the app for better visual appeal/use; ShinyWidgets - Used to change the background color of the app; VisNetwork, igraph - Used to plot the network graph. Observation: First of all, it is obvious that more countries participated in WWII than WWI. The countries in the middle are more active(it is in war with a lot of other countries). For WWI, the four countries that are most active are Germany, Austria-Hungary, Turkey, Bulgaria. Austria-Hungary initiated WWI and Germany, Turkey and Bulgaria are on the same side as Austria-Hungary. For WWII, France, Finland, Bulgaria, Italy, Germany, Romania, Hungary and Japan are the most active countries. They were all on the same side as the initiator Germany at one point during the war(France, Romania, Bulgaria and Italy switched sides once during WWII). 6.2 Interactive choropleth map Link to the Shiny app: https://priyankalahoti.shinyapps.io/shinyapp1/ We plotted the static world map for battle deaths for World War 1 and 2 back in chapter 5.2 in Figure 16. Considering that it might be a little difficult to read for some countries and we couldn’t see the actual figure for battle deaths, we decided to plot an interactive version in shiny app to help is better understand the battle deaths for countries that participated in those two wars. Usage of the app: The drop-down menu enables users to select if they want to visualize the countries involved in World War 1 or in World War 2. Once selected, the app graphically visualizes the countries. The app shows the same static graph as Figure 16 in 5.2 but when user hovers over the countries, if the country participated in that selected war, the battle death figure in thousands will show up and if the country did not participate in that selected war, it will show NA and will not have fill color. Packages Used: Shiny - Used for building and deploying the Shiny app locally; ggiraph: Used to create an interactive graphic with a ggplot object to be used in shiny app. Observation: First of all, we observe that more countries participated in WWII than WWI. We can say more definitively that the overall battle death level is higher during WWII than WWI, with USSR being the country with significantly more battle deaths than any other country in WWII. The three countries with the most battle death counts are: USSR, Germany and China: deaths in USSR is more than double the deaths in Germany and deaths in Germany is about double the deaths in China. We tried to make a cartogram according to the one in this link: We put in around 6 hours of work but were unsuccessful because it requires a really hard algorithm that we were unable to implement in another 6 hours. We also tried to make a dropdown menu that enables users to select if they want to visualize the countries involved in side A and side B. However, we were not successful in doing so as there exist some ambiguities: some countries (specifically, France, Romania, Bulgaria and Italy) changed sides once during WWII. "],
["conclusion.html", "Chapter 7 Conclusion", " Chapter 7 Conclusion Here are our most surprising findings: France initiated the most inter-state wars (8 wars), while U.S., Russia and Japan initiated the second most inter-state wars (7 wars). France, Romania, Bulgaria and Italy changed sides once during WW2. From the interactive parallel coordinate plot, we observed that while states that were not initiators of the wars tend to have lower battle deaths, USSR in WW2 did not follow that trend: even though it wasn’t an initiator, it had the highest battle deaths in all countries. Population for Japan increased steadily even during the two world wars and remained increasing even after those wars. During WW1, primary school enrollment in Germany was unaffected and had been increasing steadily. There was no apparent effect of the world wars on overall Human Development indices. As was discussed in the data section, there were some limitations in our datasets. Future Scope: More work can be done trying to find out why certain countries who lost and initiated wars. More supplementary datasets such as technological development, higher education status, study on political climate of countries, etc can be used. Our current study focuses on comparison of effect of different wars on countries. In future, to shine some light on the negative and avoidable impacts of wars, a comparative study between two countries- one of them involved in wars and other not, can be done to draw conclusions as to the state of development of these countries given their involvement in wars. Our datasets also contained information about the location of wars. A study on the geographical location of war sites and its affect on neighboring geographical areas and population can be done. "]
